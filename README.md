# About
You are a brave captain of the spaceship, who's defending earth from space invaders! However, these invaders are tricky, and they jumble the ship's controls from time to time.
# Controls
* Move left - A or Left Arrow;
* Move right - D or Right Arrow;
* Shoot - Space;

However, they can change during the fight.
# Team

We appreciate any feedback on our game. It was a hard jam, but we did our best.
